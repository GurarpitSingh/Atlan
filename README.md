This is a dummy application which includes a space accepting SQL queries in the form of user input, then execute the given query, and displays the resultant data within the application.

For the purpose of a demo, the data is not the actual result that the query would display if executed in an environment i.e. the query is not evaluated and the resultant data is not synchronized.
